# Sentiment-Prediction-PyTorch
Used PyTorch to train Neural Networks to predict the sentiment of IMDB reviews. Two architectures were used a CNN and a RNN (GRU cell). In both cases, variants with a learned and a pre-trained embedding were built. Finally, a metamodel using the four neural networks is tested.
