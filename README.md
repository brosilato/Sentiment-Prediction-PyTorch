# Sentiment-Prediction-PyTorch
Used PyTorch to train Neural Networks to predict the sentiment of IMDB reviews. Two architectures were used a CNN and a RNN (GRU cell). In both cases, variants with a learned and a pre-trained embedding were built. Finally, a metamodel using the four neural networks is tested. 

The accuracy obtained with the neural networks on the test set ranges from 86 to 88 %, while with the metamodel it gets to 97%.

Please note that neither the data nor the embedding txt file has been uploded. Please, follow the links in the notebooks to get them.
